Various scripts, custom actions or whatever for Reaper

I'm starting this repo off with a Lua script to split WAVs from both SD cards of a Behringer WING recording into 64 mono tracks which can then be rendered to stems for import elsewhere.

I'll add screenshots where applicable/useful, which will be named in line with the script they explain.
