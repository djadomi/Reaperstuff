Various scripts, custom actions or whatever for Reaper

I'm starting this repo off with a [Lua script to split WAVs from both SD cards of a Behringer WING recording](https://github.com/djadomi/Reaperstuff/blob/master/W-LIVE-64-track-separation/W-LIVE%2064%20track%20separation.lua%20Readme.md) into 64 mono tracks which can then be rendered to stems for import elsewhere.

I'll add a readme and screenshots where applicable/useful, which will be named in line with the script they explain.
